You need to remember that if you get stuck anywhere while trying to understand the problem statement, do not be overwhelmed. You are provided with plenty of annotated comments inside the stub code that shall help you accomplish the major objectives of the project. All you need to do is follow the instructions mentioned here and carefully follow the comments in the stub code and you shall be fine. Remember to screenshot the responses when you make an endpoint request as you would be required to submit them later. So, let’s get going!
